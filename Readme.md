# The not cleverly named Vermintide Mod Pack

The "not so clevery named" Vermintide mod pack is based on [Grimalackt's 
excellent "Quality of Life" mod pack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1090355288)
and adds some additional mods which I just cannot live without.

Currently the following mods have been added:

* Pause Game by UnShame
* Skip Cutscenes by UnShame

## Installation

Simply drop all the files into your Vermintide "binary" installation folder.
This can typically be found in your Steam folder under

     steamapps/common/Warhammer End Times Vermintide/binaries
